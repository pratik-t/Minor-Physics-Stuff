Determines all possible atomic configurations for $n$ given equivalent electrons, i.e. electrons having the same orbital angular momentum $l$.

Produces a Slater's table which might look as such (for two $l=p$ electrons):

| ${}_{M_l}$ ${}^{M_s}$ |  $-1$  |   $0$  |   $1$  |
|------|------|------|------|
|  $2$   |   $0$  |   $1$  |  $0$   |
|  $1$   |   $1$  |   $2$  |  $1$   |
|  $0$   |   $1$  |   $3$  |  $1$   |

 Here the top row, $m_s$ are the allowed net spin of the atom, first column, $m_l$ are the allowed net orbital angular momentum values. The table values are the number of ways to arrange the electrons for that net $m_l,\ m_s$ configuration. This also takes into account Pauli's exclusion principle.

 Also outputs the term symbols, ${}^{2S+1}L_{J}$ of the allowed final states in increasing order of energy as per Hund's rules.

 Outputs of the form $3P ( 0. 1. 2. )$ refers to $3$ term symbols in increasing order of energy, i.e. $E({}^3P_0)<E({}^3P_1)<E({}^3P_2)$
