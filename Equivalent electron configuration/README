Determines all possible atomic configurations for 'n' given equivalent electrons, i.e. electrons having the same orbital angular momentum l.

Produces a Slater's table which might look as such (for 2 l=p electrons):

ML/MS   -1      0       1

 2       0       1       0

 1       1       2       1

 0       1       3       1

 Here the top row, MS are the allowed net spin of the atom, first column, ML are the allowed net orbital angulat momentum values. The table values are the number of ways to arrange the electrons for that net ML,MS configuration. This also takes into account Pauli's exclusion principle

 Also outputs the term symbols of the allowed final states in increasing order of energy as per Hund's rules.

 Outputs of the form 3P ( 0. 1. 2. ) refers to 3 term symbols in increasing order of energy, i.e. E(3P0)<E(3P1)<E(3P2)
